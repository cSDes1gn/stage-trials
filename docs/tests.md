## Validation Tests
1. How accurately can the stage return back to its original point. Zaber claims 2μm accuracy but the microscope may not have that resolution.
2. How fast can it sample through petri trials? Measure speed of traversal (execution time) and relative capture quality.
3. Repeatability claim of 2μm
